Classical MDS（Multidemensional Scaling）is an algorithm for high dimensional data projection. Relational data layout problem can be regarded as projecting high dimensional data onto a 2D visual space.

## Usage

As the demo below, you can deploy it in `layout` while instantiating Graph. it can also be used for [Subgraph Layout](/zh/docs/manual/middle/layout/#%E5%AD%90%E5%9B%BE%E5%B8%83%E5%B1%80). By tuning the parameters, you can adjust the edge length.
